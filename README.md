## Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I'm Calvin, a Research Engineer at [Transition Zero](https://www.transitionzero.org/), an NGO that provides open data products to shape a clean energy future. I've recently finished a PhD in the [Mathematics of Planet Earth](https://mpecdt.ac.uk/) where I looked at the problem of predicting tipping points in the climate system from a mathematical perspective. 

I'm broadly interested in meteorology/climate science, renewable energy and nonlinear dynamical systems. I enjoy working on problems in these domains using a mixture of mathematical modelling, data analysis and software development.
